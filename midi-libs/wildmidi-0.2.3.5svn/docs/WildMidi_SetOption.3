.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <wildmidi_lib.h>
.PP
.B int WildMidi_SetOption (midi *\fIhandle\fP, unsigned short int \fIoptions\fP, unsigned short int \fIsetting\fP)
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
Set a library option for a specific midi.
.PP
.IP \fIhandle\fP

.PP
.B \fIoptions\fP
The option or options you wish to change.
.PP
.RS
.IP WM_MO_LOG_VOLUME
By default the library uses linear volume levels typically used in computer MIDI players. These can differ somewhat to volume levels found on some midi hardware which may use a volume curve based on decibels. This option sets the volume levels to what you'd expect on such devices.
.PP
.IP WM_MO_ENHANCED_RESAMPLING
By default libWildMidi uses linear interpolation for the resampling of the sound samples. Setting this option enables the library to use a resampling method that attempts to fill in the gaps giving richer sound.
.PP
.IP WM_MO_REVERB
libWildMidi has an 8 reflection reverb engine. Use this option to give more depth to the output.
.PP
.RE
.IP setting
To turn on an option, repeat that option here. To turn off an option, do not put the option here.
.PP
.IP Example: To turn on Reverb
WildMidi_SetOption(handle, WM_MO_REVERB, WM_MO_REVERB);
.IP Example: To turn off Reverb
WildMidi_SetOption(handle, WM_MO_REVERB, NULL);
.IP Example: To turn on Reverb and Enhanced Resampling
WildMidi_SetOption(handle, (WM_MO_REVERB | WM_MO_ENHANCED_RESAMPLING), (WM_MO_REVERB | WM_MO_ENHANCED_RESAMPLING));
