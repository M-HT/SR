# scaler-plugins

Plugins used by the DOS games to enlarge/enhance the displayed image.

To compile the plugins, run the compilation script for your platform.

If you do not want (or you are not able to) compile it by yourself, you can try to use the DLLs, or SO files from the Albion release which has these precompiled.
