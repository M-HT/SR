# pycfg

A configuration utility that can be used on Linux (sorry Windows users) to change settings in the configuration files (without editing the files).

The utility has some limitations -- edit the configuration files to overcome these.

* On PC, the resolution can be selected only from predefined values -- when editing, any resolution can be used (mainly usable in window mode).
